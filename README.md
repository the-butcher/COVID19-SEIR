This app currently is in a pre-alpha state where various features yet have to added.

The code has been moved from local storage to github for backup- and documentation purposes. I plan to work on this repository to get it finished over the upcoming weeks.

Some of the missing pieces are:
- better pre init when there is more than one strain, step in incidence at strain position
- (re)build the modification chart area for i.e. testing and other modification types
- validity check for when i.e. too many vaccinations have been configured in settings
- implement import, save, export
