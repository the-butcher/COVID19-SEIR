# COVID19-SEIR
## Age-Group granularity model. Contact-Matrix based, Vaccinations, Testing, Seasonality.

This is a private project, created in an attempt to understand the dynamics inherit to the COVID pandemic.
At the time of writing (20.06.2021) the model contains data for Austria. It should be possible to add data for other countries given the availability of age specific case and vaccination data.

Documentation will be added continuously over the next weeks.

An area where you can place "modifications" of different types. These modifications are used to alter the model by i.e. changing contact levels, adding new strains, definition seasonality.
To change configuration of a modification click the modification. A configuration area of the modification will appear in the upper right area of your browser.
To create a modification move your mouse over the timeline area. Modification types that are creatable will show a "create" thumb underneath the mouse.

To delete a modification move your mouse over the modification that you want to delete. Modifications that are deletable will display a delete button. Click the unfolded delete button to delete the modification without further notification.

### Modifications

Modifications are the configuration of the model. Except "Time", each type of modification allows to alter the behaviour of the model by changing specific settings of modification.

#### Issues
* wiki on github
* be sure that strain calibration is still functional
* with vaccination slider on zero and pre-filled vaccinations, vaccination percentage still increases after Model.MIN_TIME, try to reproduce
* border cases
  * all testing sliders on zero renders an all zero chart,
  * single testing slider on 1 percent leads to diagram stretching further an further
  * limit incidence range on modifications later than MIN_DATE to i.e. 10
  * validity check for when i.e. too many vaccinations have been configured in settings or initial percentage of recovered does not validate â†’ reset to last valid state (???)
  * keep history in local storage (or internal, reset modification after validation problems)
* find a way to reliably reproduce scenarios from 11.2020 and 03.2021


#### Backlog
* y-axis modes in relative chart (max, age-group-max, manual)
* demographics for germany (check the default priority value 10000 in ModelImplVaccination)
* explore the difference between "cases" and "total exposure" (maybe think about a solution like in model1, but may be difficult due to incidence being the central strain parameter)
* can there be a general concept for an age-wise "control-curve" [incidence, recovery, ...]
* clarify parts of the model where i.e. vaccination is handled in ModelImplRoot, attempt to get everything to the most intuitive location
* "float" mode where base-data is not relevant
* add strain names to export json
* auto save (?), if auto save there needs to be a reset (could be done through local storage history)
* implement coincident indicator on modifications, then iterate when selecting -> bring lower icons up z-wise so it can get selected
* 'deceased'
* add controls for vaccination strategy (?)
  * add sliders for priority and refusal
  * add chart showing 2 curves with priority and refusal (?)
* add immune escape to strain modification (percentage of cases that are susceptible among recovered individuals)
* zoomable chart and slider
* color-only pickers for chart-mode
* testing, validity, plausibility
  * find and eliminate most prominent performance bottlenecks
  * will caching compartments on compartmentFilter improve performance?
  * move transmission-risk calculation away from worker (could improve performance for not running each time, but only when a strain is changed)

#### Solved issues
* ~~proper default configuration~~
* ~~have a link to this readme~~
* ~~some modification-min-charts don't have values for last item~~
* ~~in the current vaccination model there is no share in 5-14~~
* ~~when the vaccination rate hits threshold there may be an edge~~
* ~~change chart range when a file is imported~~
* ~~strain slider range (1-10)~~
* ~~replace full vacc build with values from base-data~~
* ~~check vaccination model against real vaccination~~
  * ~~there would be enough overlap into the model to adjust vaccination parameters accordingly~~
* ~~redefine BaseData~~
  * ~~2nd shot data vaccination, could then prefill vaccination until 2nd shot data is fulfilled and start into the model with that status (initial percentage slider would then be obsolete)~~
  * ~~exposed (which is already there and used)~~
  * ~~recovered (for prefill with )~~
* ~~the disabled primary strain slider should show the value that is currently applicable~~
* ~~create some heatmap format that allows to show delta between model and reality~~
* ~~either have all strains at zero or find a way that strains can be placed on the timeline and still have correct incidence at their respective positions~~
* ~~there is a slight bend in cases in the initial model, which indicates a problem with initial compartment fill (?)~~
* ~~take care of primary incidence having the correct value (heatmap - sum(other))~~
* ~~change modification-resolver-strain to use StrainUtil~~
* ~~better integration of base-data -> have initial incidence from initial-data-item,~~
* ~~check model for having constant population (some submodels (i.e. incidence) do not count, ...)~~
* ~~modification time chart diagram find max values dynamically from dataset~~
  * ~~when changing a modification, then switching back to "time", the currently displayed value needs to be updated, currently a time-mod drag is required to force update~~
* ~~actions~~
  * ~~import~~
  * ~~save~~
  * ~~export~~
  * ~~png~~
  * ~~json~~
* ~~settings slider modification chart~~
* ~~make vacc-slider max and vacc-modification-chart max a function of max-population~~

* ~~create some decent chart mode toggle~~
* ~~in 'EI' mode axis labels should be LOCALE_FORMAT_FLOAT_2 formatted~~

  * ~~when exiting the chart are, cursor shall be displayed to time modification instant~~
  * ~~show effective contact matrix on a per date basis (base_contact_matrix x reduction_through_testing * nrm_susceptible of the respective age group)~~
  * ~~disable chart zoom to keep slider and chart aligned~~
* ~~modification chart axis renders decimal number~~
* ~~contact matrix chart calculates 0 percentage~~
* ~~chart testing y-axis label formatting~~
* ~~coincident strain instants produce an error when updating model~~

  * ~~while in SEIR mode, strain incidence goes visible straight away~~
  * ~~modification chart on update~~
* ~~initial model calculation~~
* ~~split modification chart to one value per day, will provide tooltips on the curve~~
  * ~~implement some type mod-value provider, one for each modification type (bonus of that type will be i.e. seasonality value provider)~~
* ~~modification chart area~~
  * ~~use rebuilt contact matrix percentage~~
  * ~~introduce percentage for testing ratio~~

* ~~strain incidence series labelling~~
* ~~better pre init when there is more than one strain~~
  * ~~accept list of modifications~~
  * ~~add some preload days~~

  * ~~keep a set of virtual strain modifications, each at virtual model start (begin of preload period)~~
  * ~~adapt virtual modifications until satisfactory precision is reached~~
  * ~~re-implement proper age-group incidence setup~~
