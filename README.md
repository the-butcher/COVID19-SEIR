This app currently is in a pre-alpha state where various features yet have to be added.

The code has been moved from local storage to github for backup- and documentation purposes. I plan to work on this repository to get it finished over the upcoming weeks (as of 22.05.2021).

current Tasks:
* better pre init when there is more than one strain
  * accept list of modifications
  * add some preload days
  * iterate a minimum of preload days to a maximum of the last strain date
  * keep a set of virtual strain modifications, each at virtual model start (begin of preload period)
  * adapt virtual modifications until satisfactory precision is reached
* (re)build the modification chart area for i.e. testing and other modification types
* rebuild contact-matrix percentage to reflect symetric values, where population has been multiplied with contact-rate
* validity check for when i.e. too many vaccinations have been configured in settings or initial percentage of recovered does not validate â†’ reset to last valid state (???)
* implement import, save, export
