This app currently is in a pre-alpha state where various feature have to be added yet.

The code has been moved from local storage to github for backup- and documentation purposes. I plan to work on this repository to get it finished over the upcoming weeks (as of 22.05.2021).

current Tasks:
* modification chart area
  * find some primary value for strain (if possible use r<sub>t</sub>)
* validity check for when i.e. too many vaccinations have been configured in settings or initial percentage of recovered does not validate â†’ reset to last valid state (???)
* implement
  * import
  * save
  * export
  * png
  * csv
* do performance tests on model integration and try to improve performance
  * will caching compartments on compartmentFilter improve performance
  * rather flip value fields than transforming model data
* create some decent chart model toggle
  * SEIR, all seir curves
  * EI (?), exposed(infected)
  * INCIDENCE
* introduce vaccination heatmap


done:
* ~~split modification chart to one value per day, will provide tooltips on the curve~~
  * ~~implement some type mod-value provider, one for each modification type (bonus of that type will be i.e. seasonality value provider)~~
* ~~modification chart area~~
  * ~~use rebuilt contact matrix percentage~~
  * ~~introduce percentage for testing ratio~~
  * ~~format percentage when applicable~~
  * ~~consider extra axis width for vaccination labels, messes up widths otherwise~~
* ~~rebuild contact-matrix percentage to reflect symetric values, where population has been multiplied with contact-rate~~
* ~~vaccinations format to % in modification chart, but should not~~
* ~~strain incidence series labelling~~
* ~~better pre init when there is more than one strain~~
  * ~~accept list of modifications~~
  * ~~add some preload days~~
  * ~~iterate a minimum of preload days to a maximum of the last strain date~~
  * ~~keep a set of virtual strain modifications, each at virtual model start (begin of preload period)~~
  * ~~adapt virtual modifications until satisfactory precision is reached~~
  * ~~re-implement proper age-group incidence setup~~
